# Backport of contains property conditions for entity privileges to Flow 4.x

This allows to have property conditions with an "contains" clause in Flow 4.x

## Installation

Define the GitHub repository as custom repository in your project and composer require afterwards.

## Configuration

After installing the package, by default nothing happens.
To use the condition you need to write your entity privileges with the provided EntityPrivilege class instead
of the default one.

## Credits

Development of this package has been sponsored by Kay Strobach.
